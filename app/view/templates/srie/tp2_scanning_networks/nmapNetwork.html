            The default host discovery done with -sn consists of an ICMP echo request, TCP SYN to port 443, TCP
           ACK to port 80, and an ICMP timestamp request by default. When executed by an unprivileged user, only
           SYN packets are sent (using a connect call) to ports 80 and 443 on the target. When a privileged user
           tries to scan targets on a local ethernet network, ARP requests are used unless --send-ip was
           specified. The -sn option can be combined with any of the discovery probe types (the -P* options) for
           greater flexibility. If any of those probe type and port number options are used, the default probes
           are overridden. When strict firewalls are in place between the source host running Nmap and the target
           network, using those advanced techniques is recommended. Otherwise hosts could be missed when the
           firewall drops probes or their responses.
